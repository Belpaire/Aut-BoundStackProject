# Aut-BoundStackProject
Thesis code in a more structured stack project. After running stack build you should be able to just easily use the resulting executable. Note that it requires hfmt (from stylish-haskell) to be in your path or working directory to work though. So make sure wherever the hfmt.exe is installed is in the path.
